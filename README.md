Simple codes could solve day by day problems like join PDF format files. If you, like me, don't pay Adobe Acrobat, you can join many PDF file in just one file using the  a simple Python code. To do this, you need:

1 - Install PyPDF2 (pip3 install PyPDF2) on terminal; and
2 - Save all your PDF file in your python project.

The final file compiled will be saved on your Python project.
